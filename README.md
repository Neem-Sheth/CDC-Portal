# Dockerized Next.js Project

This repository contains a **Next.js application** with **Nodemailer** integration, packaged for deployment using Docker. The application allows users to view job details, apply for jobs, and receive confirmation emails upon applying. 

---

## Features

- **Job Application Portal**: Users can view job details and apply for positions.
- **Email Notification**: Users receive an email confirmation when they apply for a job.
- **Dockerized Setup**: Simplified deployment using Docker and Docker Compose.
- **Database Integration**: Includes a MongoDB service for storing job and user data.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Docker**: [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- **Docker Compose**: [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## How to Run the Project Locally

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
cd your-repository-name
```

### 2. Add a `.env` File

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and configure the required environment variables:

```plaintext
PORT=3000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://mongo:27017/your_database_name
EMAIL_SERVICE=your_email_service
EMAIL_USER=your_email_address
EMAIL_PASS=your_email_password
```

> **Note**: Replace placeholders with actual values.

### 3. Build and Run the Docker Container

Build the image and start the container:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will:
- Build the application Docker image.
- Start the application and MongoDB services.

### 4. Access the Application

Open your browser and navigate to:

```plaintext
http://localhost:3000
```

- `EMAIL_SERVICE`: e.g., `gmail`
- `EMAIL_USER`: Your email address
- `EMAIL_PASS`: App password or email password (securely stored)
